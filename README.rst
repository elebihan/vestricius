Titus Vestricius Spurinna is an Haruspex, a priest who practiced divination by
looking at the entrails of animals. He is famous for having warned Julius Caesar
of his impending death.

`vestricius(1)` is a command line tool which allows the user to inspect a crash
archive generated by a program or an embedded device. A crash archive can be a
simple core dump file, or a tarball containing a core dump and log files. Once
the inspection is finished, a report in the YAML format is printed on standard
output.

For further details, read the `manual <man/vestricius.1.rst>`_.
